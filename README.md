In December 2017 we [reported on the least used station in Britain seeing the 'biggest percentage growth' in the country](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42196835).

Visits to the station rocketed 1,200%, according to the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), thanks to an offer by Great British Bake Off finalist Ian Cumming to give mince pies to people who disembarked at the station on Christmas Eve 2016: 16 people visited Shippea Hill on 24 December, more than it had had in the whole of 2015-16.
